Space Man: The Ultimate game is an isometric action shooter that was sent in to the Amiga Format Blitz Basic competition. Lost for many years, this only resurfaced recently as the Blitz Basic competition games were found on an Acid software hard drive.

The initial check in is more or less the game as-is, beyond that I've checked in several bug fixes and such.
